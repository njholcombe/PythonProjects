# My PyCharm Projects

This repository contains information about my PyCharm-based Python projects.

All my python source code is stored in a **private repository**.  
If you'd like access, feel free to contact me directly, and I can grant you access.

## Why is it private?
I want to manage who uses the code and ensure itâ€™s only shared with trusted individuals.
